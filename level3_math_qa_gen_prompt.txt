As a senior **math** instructor, your task is to create **diverse and challenging computation-based math
 questions** based on provided topics and knowledge points. These questions should demonstrate the application
 of the provided topics and key concepts while enhancing students’ reasoning and critical-thinking skills. Ensure
 that questions are **non-redundant**, precise, and engaging.
 You will be provided with a list of key mathematical concepts spanning various topics and two relevant reference
 materials.
 ### Guidelines for Creating Diverse and Challenging Computation-based Questions:
 1. **Concept Selection**:- Adhere to the Provided Topics: Ensure that each question aligns closely with the given topics.- Incorporate Multiple Concepts about Different Topics: Each question should encompass **2 or 3 key
 concepts about different math topics**.- Ensure **broad coverage** of the provided concepts across the generated questions, avoiding
 **over-reliance** on simple or common applications of concepts.- Avoid repeating the same **concept combinations** or **computational approach** across questions.
 2. **Diversity and Challenge**:- Encourage **Cross-Topic Thinking**: By integrating concepts about different math topics, questions
 will promote holistic understanding and application of mathematical principles.- **Leverage the Two Reference Materials**: The combination of both reference materials provides
 a **broader and more diverse context**, allowing for the creation of questions that explore a wider range
 of scenarios and applications. Use this to generate questions that challenge students in both familiar and
 novel contexts.- Ensure questions explore **different perspectives** and **applications** of the key concepts. Ensure each
 question is **sufficiently challenging** (e.g., requiring multi-step computations, integrating real-world
 scenarios, involving abstract or advanced reasoning.).
 3. **Clarity and Precision**:- Use precise and unambiguous language.- Write all mathematical expressions or formulas in LaTeX for clarity.- Clearly state all assumptions or conditions.
 4. **Reference Material**:- Use the provided **reference articles about different topics** as sources of inspiration for
 generating **unique, diverse, and challenging questions**.- The combination of these two materials allows you to create questions with **more varied perspectives,
 contexts, and applications**, which can help test students’ abilities to apply concepts in different situations.- The reference material is intended to:- Supplement the concept list by introducing **novel perspectives**, **contexts**, or **applications**.- Help create questions that are **more complex, much harder, and uncommon** in traditional
 teaching scenarios.- Serve as a resource to craft **real-world scenarios** or **abstract extensions** beyond the
 given concepts.
 5. **Output Diversity**:- Create between **1 to 3 questions**.- Ensure each question is unique in **structure**, **approach**, and **concept usage**.- Minimize the use of **sub-questions**, unless they are essential to the problem’s complexity.- The answer should either be exact, or if not possible, then the question should clearly say the answer is
 only expected to be approximately correct.
