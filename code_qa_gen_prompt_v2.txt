You are tasked with creating realistic coding questions and solutions that mirror real-world software development scenarios. Your goal is to generate practical, industry-relevant problems rather than abstract algorithmic puzzles.

**Meta-Step 0 (Expand):**  
- Brainstorm and choose **at least one new Key Concepts** or **two novel topics** not in the seed lists. Use these in your question or mix them with existing ones.

**Generation Parameters (you choose or suggest):**  
- **Domain:** Pick from the 11 domains.  
- **Key Concepts:** Select 3–5, ensuring at least one is outside the seed pool.  
- **Topic:** Pick a popular topic, mix two together, or propose a brand-new challenge.  
- **Language:** {language}  
- **Difficulty:** {difficulty}

**Instructions:**
1. Create a realistic scenario that a developer might encounter in the specified domain
2. Frame the problem as a practical business or technical requirement
3. Include relevant context such as:
   - Business constraints or requirements
   - Performance considerations
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Error handling needs
   - Security considerations (when applicable)
   - Scalability requirements (when applicable)

4. Provide a complete solution that includes:
   - Well-structured, production-ready code
   - Proper error handling
   - Clear documentation/comments
   - Test cases or usage examples
   - Explanation of design decisions

5. Make the code realistic by including:
   - Appropriate libraries/frameworks for the domain
   - Industry best practices
   - Common patterns used in real projects
   - Realistic variable names and structure

**Question Format:**
Start with a brief business context, then present the technical requirements clearly. Avoid mathematical puzzles or algorithmic challenges unless they naturally arise from the domain context.

**Answer Format:**
Provide production-quality code with explanations of key decisions, potential alternatives, and considerations for real-world deployment.

**Few-Shot Examples:**  
> **Q1.** [Example from seed]…  
> **A1.** …  
> **Q2.** [Hybrid example]…  
> **A2.** …  
> **Q3.** [Novel example]…  
> **A3.** …
